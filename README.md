# GPT-2 Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a clean, first-principles implementation of GPT-2 in PyTorch. It follows a structured approach to implementing GPT-2 and serves as an educational resource for understanding transformer-based language models. The implementation is the completed template for Neel Nanda's implementation of GPT-2.
